    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of white rice (long-grain, medium-grain, or short-grain)</li>
        <li>2 cups of water</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed rice and water. Add a pinch of salt if desired, which can enhance the flavor of the rice</li>
        <li>Place the saucepan on the stove over high heat and bring the water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low to maintain a gentle simmer</li>
        <li>Cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
        <li>Allow the rice to simmer, covered, for about 18-20 minutes for long-grain rice, or according to the package instructions for other types of rice. Avoid lifting the lid or stirring the rice during this time, as it can interfere with the cooking process.</li>
        <li>After the cooking time is complete, remove the saucepan from the heat but keep the lid on.</li>
        <li>Let the rice rest, covered, for an additional 5 minutes. This allows the steam to evenly distribute, resulting in fluffy and tender rice.</li>
        <li>After resting, uncover the saucepan and fluff the rice gently with a fork to separate the grains.</li>
    </ol>
